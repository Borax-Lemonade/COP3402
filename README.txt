compile the source code as gcc driver.c lex.c

I havent run it against any other inputs other than the first given one and my own personal one
it also doesnt completely ignore whitespace,,,

#todo -- go back and ensure print, compiler, and driver were not changed -- if so write it down here(how and why)
